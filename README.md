This project focuses on predicting chronic kidney disease using various machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset contains demographic, credit application specific, credit history, collateral, and financial attributes.

## Machine Learning Models

We applied five machine learning models to predict chronic kidney disease:

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Tree**
4. **XGBoost**
5. **CatBoost**

### Results

XGBoost and CatBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 99%.

## Deep Learning Models

We also explored Deep Learning models:

1. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
2. **Hybrid Model (LSTM + CNN)**

### Results

ANN achieved the highest accuracy among deep learning models with 99%.

## Explainable AI Techniques

We used Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret the models:

1. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**

2. **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**
